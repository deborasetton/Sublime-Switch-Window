This script would not have been possible without the immense help of Google and the awesome people of the Web.

I'd like to thank the author of this very nice and detailed [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10366003/applescript-google-chrome-activate-a-certain-window) on which I based the scripts to get the names of all open windows and change the current window.

This [other answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4537259/python-how-to-pipe-the-output-using-popen) was crucial for getting the aforemetioned scripts to work. I ran into a lot of problems for running an applescript that targets Sublime from a Sublime plugin, and this answer provided the only solution that worked for me.

Also, without this [other answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13337298/how-can-i-get-a-list-of-menu-items-with-applescript) allowed me to get the names of open windows. I don't know much AppleScript, so I basically relied on these answers to get the job done.
